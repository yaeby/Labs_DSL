'''The following sybols:
    * - Matches 0 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
    + - Matches 1 or more (greedy) repetitions of the preceding RE.
    Greedy means that it will match as many repetitions as possible.
        Thus, we create a limit variable. 
        So for LIMIT = 3, maximum of (ab)* will be ababab'''

LIMIT = 10
